         <p class="comment">Unlike the hearty oatmeal you are familiar with, baked oats taste just like an ultra-tender banana bread breakfast cake kissed with a hint of warm cinnamon, and studded with chocolate chips.</p><p class="comment"> If oatmeal has a regular spot in your breakfast routine or you have a serious soft spot for all things banana bread, you have to try baked oats.</p>
         <h3 class="title">Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 medium ripe bananas</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup old-fashioned or quick-cooking oats</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons liquid sweetener, such as maple syrup, honey, or agave nectar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chocolate chips, divided</li>
         </ul>
         <h4 class="title">How to prepare</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350F.</li>
            <li>Lightly coat 2 (8-ounce) ramekins with cooking spray. Place on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Place 2 medium peeled bananas, 2 large eggs, 1 cup old-fashioned or quick-cooking oats, 2 tablespoons sweetener, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a blender. Blend on high speed until smooth, 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour into the ramekins. Add 2 tablespoons chocolate chips to each ramekin and use the handle of the tablespoon to stir to combine. Let sit for 5 minutes so the oats can absorb the liquid.</li>
            <li>Bake until the oatmeal is puffed, pulls away from the sides of the ramekin, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
         </ol>

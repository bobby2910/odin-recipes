         <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
         <p class="comment">This sweet potato soup is velvety and smooth, warm from the addition of cinnamon and garam masala, and gently spiced with fresh ginger and crushed red pepper.</p><p class="comment"> Roasting the sweet potatoes deepens their flavor and sweetness, balancing well with the bold spices. Blending everything with a bit of heavy cream results in the silkiest of soups.</p>

         <h4 class="title">How to prepare</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 425F.</li>
            <li>Halve 2 pounds sweet potatoes lengthwise and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 4 teaspoons of the olive oil and season with 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper. Toss to coat, then arrange in a single layer cut-side down.</li>
            <li>Roast until the potatoes are fork tender, 25 to 35 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the aromatics. Thinly slice 1 medium yellow onion (about 2 cups). Finely chop 6 large garlic cloves (about 2 tablespoons). Peel and finely grate 1 (4-inch) piece fresh ginger until you have 2 tablespoons.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat until the butter is melted. Add the onion, 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Cook, stirring often, until softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, a pinch of red pepper flakes if using, and 1/2 teaspoon garam masala. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and the garam masala is slightly toasted, about 2 minutes more. Remove the pot from the heat.</li>
            <li>Use a spoon to scoop the flesh of the sweet potatoes into the pot; discard the skins. Add 1/2 cinnamon stick, 1 (32-ounce) carton low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Stir to combine and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the sweet potatoes and aromatics are very soft and the flavors meld, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat.. Remove and discard the cinnamon stick. Add 1/4 cup heavy cream and stir to combine. Working in batches as needed, transfer the soup to a blender and blend until smooth and creamy, 2 to 4 minutes per batch. Transfer the blended soup back to the pot. (Alternatively, blend directly in the pot with an immersion blender.) Rewarm the soup over medium-low heat if needed. Serve topped with a drizzle of heavy cream and toasted bread on the side if desired.</li>
         </ol>
